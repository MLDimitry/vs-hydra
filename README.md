You can help develop this theme further by contributing to the github repo.

## Installing

This extension is available for free in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/juanmnl.vscode-theme-hydra)  

## Inconsistencies?
This is a very early-stage port, so expect lots of inconcistencies, but you can help:

If you find any inconsistency in any language, raise an Issue and I'll fix it, please provide a sample for the language so I can compare. 

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).
