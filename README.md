# README

## Hydra v3 is here! :D

V3 comes with some VERY, VERY big changes! (and even a "plus-size")
Hope you like them. :D

Hydra and Hydra Plus come with italic versions, so you can take advantage of those new fonts some of you are using.

_(This **was** a port of my atom's syntax theme "hydra" (link on bottom) but I have taken this one a bit forward)_

You can help develop this theme further by contributing to the github repo.

Thanks and don't forget to say hi!! :)

## Hydra Plus

Hydra Plus comes with an extra color that makes things more readable but your eyes will get tired a bit quicker than the original version.

## Installing

This extension is available for free in the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/juanmnl.vscode-theme-hydra)`

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your
liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

I use [Dank Mono Font](https://dank.sh/) with ligatures
enabled in the screenshots.

_To enable font ligatures add this to your config:_

`"editor.fontLigatures": true,`
