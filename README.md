# README

## This is a port of my atom's syntax theme "hydra" :D

Hail Hydra! Focused on readability and long-term usage.

You can help develop this theme further by contributing to the github repo.

Thanks and don't forget to say hi!! :)

## Installing

This extension is available for free in the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/juanmnl.vscode-theme-hydra)`

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your
liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

I use [Fira Code Font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with ligatures
enabled in the screenshots.

_To enable font ligatures add this to your config:_

`"editor.fontLigatures": true,`
