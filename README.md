## Installing

This extension is available for free in the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/juanmnl.vscode-theme-hydra)

## Inconsistencies?

This is a very early-stage port, so expect lots of inconcistencies, but you can
help:

If you find any inconsistency in any language, raise an Issue and I'll fix it,
please provide a sample for the language so I can compare.

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your
liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).
